<div class="question">
<p><b>Answer the following question</b>: Think about the bugs and challenges you
  had in your JOS code, and identify 1 or 2 that would have been helped by
  writing JOS in a high-level language. Would it be worth switching to a
  high-level language for the JOS labs?  (Use the bugs/challenges you identified
  to argue yes or no.)
